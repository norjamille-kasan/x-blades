- Tired of creating new (reusable) components from scratch every time I start a new TALL stack-based project
- Download everything you need in the Traits Folder and the components folder, and place them wherever you want to use them.
- Customize however you want; it's just a component starter, after all.
- And don't  laught at my codes, it works for me :)
